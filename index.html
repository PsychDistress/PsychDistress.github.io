					<p>PsychologicalDistress.Org is a global campaign committed to eradicating the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness, by forcing a change in medical terminology.</p>

<p>Whilst we recognise that vast sums of money, and enormous amounts of time have already been spent on this most important of human rights endeavours, we believe that the only real way to eradicate the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness is to completely remove it from global medical terminology.</p>

<p>It may sound simple (or even irrelevant) to some however, we firmly believe that by replacing the term "Mental Illness" with the term "Psychological Distress" will within our own generation, if not completely eradicate the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness, it will certainly come close to achieving this goal.</p>

<p>Please stay tuned as we continue to our work to begin this campaign in 2017.</p>
